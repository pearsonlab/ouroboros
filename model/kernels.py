"""
These kernel functions define the nonlinearity of our model. They are separate to make analysis
a little easier and code a little cleaner.
In general, these require a number of terms, an x dim, a z dim, and an activation function.
The activation function we typically use is the identity, but one could further constrain 
the structure of the nonlinearity by changing the activation

For all experiments, we use the FullPolyModule.
This can be extended to other kernels, but if you wanto to use them you can implement them yourselves
